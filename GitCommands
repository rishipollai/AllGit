===================================

If you've already committed a bunch of unwanted files, you can unstage them and tell git to mark them as deleted (without actually deleting them) with

git rm --cached -r .

--cached tells it to remove the paths from staging and the index without removing the files themselves and -r operates on directories recursively. You can then git add any files that you want to keep tracking.
