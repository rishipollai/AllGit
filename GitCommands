===================================

If you've already committed a bunch of unwanted files, you can unstage them and tell git to mark them as deleted (without actually deleting them) with

git rm --cached -r .

--cached tells it to remove the paths from staging and the index without removing the files themselves and -r operates on directories recursively. You can then git add any files that you want to keep tracking.
==============================================

Go to file folder you want to edit. In our case, for example, it is a folder containing git repository with readme.md file.
Type vim readme.md
Get to the edit/insert mode by typing [i] keyboard.
Fix the typo.
Hit [Esc] keyboard to leave the vim insert mode.
And finally, type :w for writing the change or :x for saving and exiting the vim. Hit [Enter] and execute the command.
